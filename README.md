# Automated Extraction of Quotations From Text

A quotation is a piece of saying or writing that strikes people so true or memorable that it is used in speech or writing. It is authoritative, motivating, inspiring, entertaining, or attention-grabbing.

However, these qualities are not limited to just the sayings of famous people. Any user-generated content can potentially contain pieces of text that possess the same qualities.

We first build a dataset of text consisting of sentences, train machine learning and deep learning models to predict which are quotations and which are not.

Then the most accurate model is deployed as an Application Programming Interface (API) to extract potential quotations from any text.
