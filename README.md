# Automated Extraction of Quotations From Text

A quotation is a piece of saying or writing that strikes us so true or memorable that it is quoted by others and used in speech or writing. It is authoritative, motivating, inspiring, entertaining, or attention-grabbing.

However, these text qualities are not limited to just the sayings of famous people. Anyone can generate content that potentially can be used as quotations too. What if there is a system to extract potential quotable quotes from any text given?

We first build a dataset of text consisting of sentences, train machine learning and deep learning models to predict which are quotations and which are not. Then we deploy the most accurate model an Application Programming Interface (API) to be used by any applications to extract quotations from text.
